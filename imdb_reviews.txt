Great Concept, But Serious Logical Flaws. Christopher Nolan's Tenet is an ambitious and creative film with an interesting core idea-playing with time inversion as a storytelling and action mechanic. The cinematography, sound design, and set pieces are impressive. However, while the concept is fascinating, the execution is riddled with logical inconsistencies that undermine its own rules. One of the key contradictions is the bunker scene where inverted characters are inexplicably breathing regular air. The movie establishes that inverted people require oxygen masks since their lungs can't process normal air. Yet, in this scene, multiple inverted characters, including the protagonist, are moving around just fine without masks. This completely contradicts the movie's own rules and is either a major oversight or an unexplained loophole. However, the biggest flaw in the movie's logic comes from the turnstiles. The plot treats the "algorithm" as a critical device that must be destroyed to prevent time inversion. But throughout the film, we see multiple turnstiles in various locations-Oslo, Sator's bunker, and even during the final battle, where large numbers of soldiers are inverted at once. If inversion is already widespread and multiple machines exist, what exactly does destroying the algorithm accomplish? The film never clarifies this contradiction. If turnstiles are so readily available, then stopping one would be meaningless. This makes the entire premise questionable and weakens the stakes.
In my point of view, Tenet deserves credit for its originality, but for a film that asks its audience to follow complex mechanics, these fundamental errors make it hard to take seriously. The idea is great, but the execution doesn't hold up under scrutiny.


To understand you have to watch it multiple times. Tenet is an amazing movie that completely blew my mind. The story is really complicated, but in a good way. It kept me thinking, and after watching it a few times, I started to understand more of what was happening. Christopher Nolan's direction is genius, and the way he plays with time is something I've never seen before in a film. The action scenes are out of this world, especially the inverted fight sequences. The airport battle is definitely my favorite-so unique and intense, with the choreography being top-notch. The way they manage to film everything in reverse while still making it look seamless is just incredible. What really shocked me was finding out that the airplane sequence was actually real and not just CGI. It's mind-blowing that they pulled off something that big in a real setting. Overall, Tenet is a movie that demands your attention. It's complex, full of action, and definitely worth watching more than once to fully appreciate. If you love movies that make you think and have mind-bending action, this one is a must-watch.


DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT. Unique idea from Nolan, no one else could have come up with something like this. Too underrated and too criticized. The only problem perhaps is the interpretations of the characters, only Robert Pattinson gave a noteworthy performance.
Film too complicated? Maybe for some yes, but after watching it 2 times you understand most of the plot and how reverse entropy works. You don't have to be a genius to appreciate this film, in fact the entire film and almost all of Christopher Nolan's filmography can be summed up in one sentence: "DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, FEEL IT". If you stop trying to understand everything and start enjoying the movie, this is undoubtedly a Masterpiece with a capital letter.


excellent film. Even though I am a movie junkie, I did not watch this movie earlier bcs everyone was complaining that it was weird and incomprehensible and had no meaning at all. I watched it last night and I found it excellent. Even though the plot is not simple and even though time travel has been done a lot in many movies, it is the first time I saw a movie that dealt with it so masterfully. Do not let the negative reviews stop you from enjoying this masterpiece. Excellent cast choice, everyone was perfect for their roles. It is fast-paced, it is interesting and it is very enjoyable. Christopher Nolan is a very gifted director, he exploits various angles of the same matter. I definitely recommend this movie.


"What's happened, happened" is an expression of faith in the world's mechanics". This film represents the pinnacle of Chris Nolan's work in the SCI-FI genre, showcasing one of his finest creations to date. It's important to note that the film doesn't focus on time travel, which is common in many films, but rather explores "TIME INVERSION" through the manipulation of entropy. The plot is incredibly complex, so I recommend rewatching the scenes, watching YouTube videos, or reading online to fully grasp what's happening. Once you understand it, you'll realize it's a "less understood/misunderstood masterpiece." The timing of its release may not have allowed the film to reach as many viewers as it deserved. The cast gave their all, and lastly, the soundtrack/background score is highly underrated.


One of the trippiest, most bonkers movies in recent memory. Tenet, despite its reputation as the film that nearly wrecked Christopher Nolan's career, is one of those movies that demands to be seen more than once, both for the spectacle and to fully comprehend the plot. Now, that's not to say the plot's impossible to understand on the first viewing; I was able to follow it fine my first time. But, there's no denying this is Nolan's most complex movie to date, both story-wise and thematically. For some, that can be a bit too much to take in; for me, I am captivated and pretty much hooked from beginning to end. The use of time travel in particular is where the film most shines; not only is it a highly original take on the concept, but it leads to some absolutely crazy ideas and fantastic sequences. Nolan knows how to find the right casts for his movies, and this one's no exception. John David Washington shows that he inherited his dad's acting talents, being both cool and charming as the protagonist, who's amusingly just called the Protagonist. Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are great secondary protagonists. Debicki is especially good as a woman trapped in the ultimate nightmare marriage with a controlling psychopath for a husband. And Kenneth Branagh is an absolutely terrifying villain, one who goes beyond just no nonsense; he's blunt, to the point, and wastes no time at all with niceties. He knows what he wants and not getting it is not only not an option, it means the worst case scenario for anyone in his way. It's hard to tell which effects are practical and which are CG, but if I had to guess, I'd say most of them are practical, which makes them all the more impressive. All it takes is something as simple as having people, animals, and vehicles moving backward instead of forward to really give the audience an idea of this world and how the time travel mechanics work, as well as just being a total mind trip to look at. Nolan's usual phenomenal direction really sells the surreality of this, especially when we see people moving backward and forward side to side. The action, especially in the second half, goes all in on utilizing this premise in various crazy scenarios. The music is awesome as you'd expect from a Nolan film. And while people say the sound editing is bad, I never noticed, though part of that may be because I always have the subtitles on. Maybe I should watch without them next time.
Overall, Tenet is a film you either absolutely love or absolutely hate. Personally, I absolutely love it. In a year where the world was at its lowest point, this is the kind of surreal film that was truly in the right place at the right time. And even all these years later, it more than holds up.


Pleasing to look at, but a confusing story. I was deeply in love with all of Christopher Nolan's movies so when I first sat down to watch Tenet, I'd had rather high expectations. Tenet is a mixed bag for me. This is mainly due to the film being underwhelming one of its main key aspects: the story. Now, usually Nolan creates great stories, but unfortunately, Tenet is one of his weaker entries. Starting with the positives first, the action sequences in this film are nothing short of breath-taking. Nolan's cinematography skills really shine through with some of the fight scenes here. Definitely the most memorable is when The Protagonist fights a mysterious masked man, who turns out to be the reversed time Protagonist. Using four different angles and perspectives to pull off the fight was genius and flawlessly executed. The subtle foreshadowing to the unknown masked man being The Protagonist was cleverly set up. The rest of the action scenes were also well edited and put together with an array of intelligent tricks to give off the effects of backwards perspectives. My biggest takeaway from Tenet was that Robert Pattinson was phenomenal in his role as Neil. He was able to bring to life a charismatic, likable badass. The soundtrack for Tenet was also amazing. Nolan changed up from Hans Zimmer and brought in Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who later composed Oppenheimer. Göransson created a fitting soundtrack that gave off an eerie and almost glitchy and broken effect. Lastly, as per usual, Christopher Nolan's cinematography and set pieces were on point. Whether it be slow motion shots on a highway in Zagreb, to a fast paced, multiple cut fistfight in Oslo, Nolan yet again perfected his skills as a director. As for the negatives, Tenet really lacks much depth and the story is too confusing. I understand the whole concept of time perspectives well enough to know what is happening, but other than that, the whole movie's premise is just too underdeveloped and confusing. Think of the plot like Inception's, but ten times more confusing and ten times less developed. Secondly, the characters weren't all that great. John David Washington did all that he could to bring The Protagonist some life, but he still was just a generic CIA agent that had to take down the bad guys. Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh gave well enough performances, but they weren't anything special. Overall, Tenet is still an excellent film to watch if you don't care too much about how things work and if you're looking for something visually pleasing to watch. It's still far from being bad, but it's among Christopher Nolan's lesser films. It's a deserved 8/10 from me purely because of how well the cinematography and action scenes work together.


A totally unique cinematic experience. Not quite a perfect 10, mind, but it's a totally unique cinematic experience. The whole "inversion" thing, where time runs backwards for stuff and people, is brilliant, if a bit baffling. The inverted fights and car chases are something else - you've never seen anything like it. And the music is absolutely banging, keeping you on the edge of your seat. John David Washington's carrying the weight of the mission with a quiet intensity. Robert Pattinson got this cool, mysterious vibe, making you wonder what he's all about. The rest of the cast do their bit, but the film's all about the twisty plot, its reveals, and the storytelling.
Now, let's be honest, it's complicated, and some people might find it a bit much. But that's a film you want to chat about with your mates, trying to figure it all out. And the music! Let's not forget the music - it's top-notch and really adds to the atmosphere.


Unnecessary, illogical and boring. The concept is unnecessary. Why do we need to create a world like this one? They shot the majority of scenes as usual, just put them in the movie as running in reversal. First 2-3 scenes exite you bit then the excitement goes away. Looks like you are watching a movie in reverse mode with background music. It reminds me of a joke, a man was watching his wedding video in reverse mode. His wife asked why you are watching it in reverse, the man replies it fulfils my desire to get my wedding undone😂. As child I enjoyed watching some movies in reverse in a VCR for fun. And laughed when someone climbs down a horse or runs backward. But whole movie watching in this way??? Naaah.


Loved it so much. Best movie ever. Never seen anything like this. The concept. Music. Reminds me of Batman trilogy. If you like anything with a style this a movie with style. Best movie ever. Never seen anything like this. The concept. Music. Reminds me of Batman trilogy. If you like anything with a style this a movie with style. Best movie ever. Never seen anything like this. The concept. Music. Reminds me of Batman trilogy. If you like anything with a style this a movie with style. Best movie ever. Never seen anything like this. The concept. Music.

If Only I Had Ten More Brain Cells...A lot of the audience members of Tenet have complained that Tenet is too confusing to enjoy, and that's what unfortunately makes Tenet so unenjoyable at times for me. I already knew that Tenet was supposed to be confusing when going into the movie, so I tried my best to focus and listen, and yet I still got confused. There's a lot of different timelines going on with mashing sub plots, and the film didn't do a great job at explaining everything. Maybe it's just me, but the film was just really hard to follow. I even watched an explanation video, and that was even confusing. The plot is just really complex, and even though I couldn't really follow it the whole time, I still appreciated it because of how smart and deep it is. Aside from the plot, everything is near perfect. The inverted fight scenes were crazy in the best ways possible. There were times where I was just blown away by some of the scenes, and I questioned how Christopher Nolan filmed it Tenet is the first of its kind, and the fact that Christopher Nolan nailed it, I think he deserves some awards for that. Tenet is a really solid movie. With good performances from the actors, great action scenes, amazing direction, and an extremely complex and mind-blowing plot. Tenet deserves nothing less than a 7/10. And if you're going into this film for the first time, then prepare to awake the sixth sense, because this film will destroy every last brain cell.


This movie rewards you for seeing it again. I'm not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered "annoying bad" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn't understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I'm not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn't perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain.


Too complicated for nothing. I'm a big fan of Nolan and having some complexity to movies but it should not be the whole plot, if you don't take into account the time reverse thing the movie is really empty and it's just a bad action movie. The time thing is not interesting enough to be the whole movie. The scene that are supposed to at suspense don't have your attention because you are trying to understand the plot. The acting isn't great, the character are not putting emotion into it, and I thing the form of the movies where it never stop is not letting them doing anything. Overall it's not that bad of a movie but it's too complicated and the actor are not helping it at all.


I understood it and still didn't like it much. I wrote a small essay in order to keep up with the story and even then, only by the skin of my teeth. But then, in the final few minutes, when the big bad thing has seemingly been avoided, I was in a maze of incomprehensibility again. This film is all about the ying and yang, how everything needs balance, but Nolan failed to see that the ability to follow this story also needs the same balance. Travel far enough and you'll come back on yourself, bury your hand in ice, it will feel like it's burning... make a film that is so intelligent... it's dumb again. Nolan has been given the impression that the audience are smart: they could cope with Inception, yup, it was great. But then Nolan must have thought "so, the audience can follow complex plot-lines... of any complexity" and forgot that we are not in his head and being lost in his own bubble. A couple of moments in the film throw us totally off and require many re-watches to figure out but some are dumb: at one point, our uninspiring protagonist (why this actor?!) shoots at himself and nothing can explain that away. He is trying to kill himself...?! And then there are the masks: pretty much our only clear indication that things are running in reverse. But Nolan mucks around with that concept too, confusing us further. You can have too much intelligence. You can have too much of anything. Unsatisfying. Oh, and stop it with the "saving one person against the world" thing. We get it. It's been done.




If you are into movies, Tenet is your jam. If you want to enjoy an intriguing and interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, then TENET is a great choice. My IMAX experience: A bit of a headache at start but 20min later the headache gets bigger. About 1 hour in the film, it turns into a migraine. And about 1h 45m in, the head explodes! So... I had to go again and watch it. The 2nd time was very rewarding. No headache and i could see through many details and respect the effort making this film. Overall, this is an outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. There is almost no green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts are a fact and you can enjoy a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX twice (it's all shot in IMAX cameras btw). Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times. I don't think I have seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was very confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding. Now I guess many of you are still confused. I was too. But once you figure it out, it all makes sense. Except some nonsense. 9/10, good solid film.


As a massive Nolan fan, this film is almost perplexing to the point where it's just plain ridiculous plotting. Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.


More Action than Sci Fi. On first viewing I will agree with many that the movie is a little difficult to follow . It's a demanding watch on plenty of levels . Where Interstellar and Inception both spent plenty of time throughout the film introducing the science behind it all Tenet ignores it , mostly . They do spell out the concept in a couple of brief scenes but then abandon any science in favour of action .There is plenty of relentless high voltage action if that's your thing and some genuine stunt work was great to see but it all becomes a little pointless if you don't really understand why it's all happening .If you don't like it really loud take some ear plugs . The score is thundering but a little overused for my liking . It is accomplished and brilliant film making but my first impressions were that I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his previous films . I'll start with a 7 but I believe it has the potential to grow on me . It is a visual treat that's for sure .


Over complicated doesn't mean geniuS. In simplistic manner, i would like to tell fellow bourgeoisie looking to comsume media, if you have one good day in the week, dont waste it on this one. But if you are a forty something dude with a podcast looking to impress Dads in your neighbourhood, i would say break a leg. Might a few nerds disagrees with me on this while reviving the Temporal paradox theories but any good director need to get the basics right before it starts showing the big brains. As few Smarty Pants states that this movie requires multiple viewing to understand, I would argue that a good story should be UNDERSTANDABLE with a single viewing when viewer paying attention. I know , i know i am not smart enough to understand the movie mannnnn. Out of the 5 elements of a story it only gets few right. I won't rant about the sound desing or editing etc, i am sure you can find complaining on internet even if you aren't looking for one.


TENET. This is as good as Cinema gets. I didn't expect that Nolan would create such a original movie once again. This is never been done before. It's incredible - one of the best Movies I've ever sen and I actually think that This movie tops Inception. I have seen Tenet now 3 times for the last 2 weeks and tomorrow it's going to be my fourth time. Time never been put on screen like this before. Its mindblowing thrill ride with soundtrack, acting and action that has never been seen on the big screen! 10/10 I Will watch it again and again and again. The movie has exceptionelly a lot of hidden messages that will blow your mind when you figure it out. This is as I Said as good as cinema gets. Christopher Nolan is the only director that still makes cinema Alive and the only one that makes This big bold unique original movies. Love This movie. This might be my favourite movie of all time. If you don't understand it see it again!
